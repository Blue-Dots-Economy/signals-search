# FROZEN WIRE CONTRACT — list-view sort + area (#644)

**Status:** FROZEN 2026-09-03. Do not change unilaterally.
**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-03-list-view-sort-domain-and-card-metric-design.md`
**Consumed by:** `2026-09-03-signals-search-sort-paging-text.md` (repo: signals-search)
and `2026-09-03-signals-dpg-list-view.md` (repo: Signals-DPG)

---

## Why this document exists

The two repos are being implemented **in parallel, in separate sessions**.
Signals-DPG's tests never touch a real signals-search — every test mocks the
client module or its `fetch` (`apps/api/src/services/signals_search_client.ts:6-8`).
So both halves can compile, both test suites can pass, and integration can
still fail on the dev cluster if the two sessions invent different field names.

**This file is the only shared truth.** Both plans are written against it.

> **If you are implementing either side and believe this contract is wrong:
> STOP. Do not "fix" it locally.** Report the problem, get the contract
> amended here first, and let the other session pick up the amendment. A
> unilateral change produces a green build and a broken deploy.

## 1. signals-search `POST /v1/search` — request

Two **new optional** fields, both inside `message.intent`.

```ts
// signals-search/src/api/schemas.ts — IntentSchema
{
  // ...existing: textSearch, item, spatial, filters

  /**
   * NEW. Explicit ordering. When ABSENT, ordering falls back to today's
   * inferred behaviour (cosine if a query vector exists, else distance if a
   * spatial clause exists, else recency) — so existing callers are unaffected.
   */
  sort?: 'relevance' | 'newest' | 'nearest';

  /**
   * NEW. A centre used ONLY for ordering. It NEVER contributes a WHERE
   * predicate. This is the capability that makes "location may sort but must
   * not truncate" expressible; `spatial` continues to filter, unchanged.
   * GeoJSON order — [lng, lat].
   */
  orderingCenter?: { type: 'Point'; coordinates: [number, number] };
}
```

### 1.1 Placement is load-bearing

Both fields **MUST** live inside `intent`, not on `message` beside
`pagination`. `cacheKey(normalized)` (`search_route.ts:64-65`) hashes
`{networkId, domain, itemType, intent, pagination}`. Inside `intent`, the cache
key is correct for free. Beside `pagination`, **two different sorts share a
cache entry.** There is a required test for this (search plan Task 2).

### 1.2 Resolution rules — normative

Applied in this order. The result is reported back as `meta.sort_applied`.

| Requested `sort` | Precondition | If met | If NOT met |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | an anchor (`intent.item.id`) **or** `textSearch` is present | cosine order | **fall back to `newest`** |
| `newest` | none | `created_at` order | n/a |
| `nearest` | a centre resolves (see 1.3) | distance order, **no radius bound** | **fall back to `newest`** |
| *absent* | — | today's inferred behaviour | n/a |

**Fallbacks never error.** A caller asking for an order it cannot have gets
`newest` and is told so via `meta.sort_applied`.

### 1.3 Centre resolution for `sort: 'nearest'`

First match wins:

1. `intent.orderingCenter.coordinates`
2. `intent.spatial[0].geometry.coordinates` (when an area filter is also set,
   its centre doubles as the ordering centre)
3. the anchor item's own stored location (already resolved as `anchorLat` /
   `anchorLng`, `search_route.ts:58-59`)
4. none of the above → fall back to `newest`

### 1.4 `spatial` is unchanged

`intent.spatial` keeps its exact current meaning: an `ST_DWithin` **filter**,
with `distanceMeters` defaulting to `SEARCH_DEFAULT_DISTANCE_METERS` (30 000)
when omitted. Do not alter it, and do not make `sort: 'nearest'` imply it.

---

## 2. signals-search `POST /v1/search` — response

One **new field**, always present.

```ts
// signals-search/src/api/schemas.ts — SearchResponseSchema
message: {
  items: ItemResult[],
  meta: {
    total: number,
    limit: number,
    offset: number,
    /**
     * NEW, ALWAYS PRESENT. The sort that was actually applied, after the
     * §1.2 fallbacks. Present even when the request sent no `sort`, in which
     * case it names whichever inferred path ran. The UI must never claim an
     * order it did not get.
     */
    sort_applied: 'relevance' | 'newest' | 'nearest',
  }
}
```

Additive, so old callers ignore it.

---

## 3. signals-search `ORDER BY` — exact SQL

Every clause ends in `s.item_id ASC`. This is the P1 fix and it is
**non-negotiable** — without it `LIMIT/OFFSET` duplicates and skips rows across
pages (spec §3.4).

```sql
-- relevance
ORDER BY s.embedding <=> :vec ASC, s.item_id ASC

-- newest   (items.created_at, NOT item_search.indexed_at — spec D5)
ORDER BY i.created_at DESC, s.item_id ASC

-- nearest  (no radius predicate is added by this sort)
ORDER BY ST_Distance(
           s.geo,
           ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(:lng, :lat), 4326)::geography
         ) ASC NULLS LAST, s.item_id ASC
```

The three **inferred** (no-`sort`) paths get the same `, s.item_id ASC`
suffix, including the existing `s.indexed_at DESC` one.

---

## 4. signals-search text predicate (#148) — exact behaviour

`textSearch` becomes an **additional `WHERE` predicate**, ANDed with existing
conditions, and is applied **whether or not an anchor is present.**

- The gate at `search_route.ts:74` (`!message.intent.item?.id &&`) is removed.
- When an anchor IS present: the anchor's embedding remains the query vector;
  text only narrows.
- When no anchor is present: text continues to become the query vector **and**
  now also narrows.
- Fields matched: the `vectorize: true` set,
  `deps.registry.vectorizeFields(networkId, domain, itemType)` — the same
  content that defines semantic relevance (spec §3.3).
- `item_search` does not store serialized text, so the predicate runs against
  `i.item_state` via the existing `JOIN items i`.

Shape (OR across fields, ANDed into `conds`):

```sql
(COALESCE(i.item_state->>'field_a','') ILIKE '%' || :q || '%'
 OR COALESCE(i.item_state->>'field_b','') ILIKE '%' || :q || '%')
```

**Known looseness, accepted:** for an array-valued field, `->>'f'` yields the
serialized JSON array as text (`["solar","wind"]`), so `ILIKE` matches against
that text form. Acceptable for a narrowing predicate; documented, not fixed
here.

---

## 5. Signals-DPG `POST /v1/network/item/discover` — request

```ts
// packages/schemas/src/api/discover_schemas.ts — DiscoverItemsBodyBase
{
  // ...existing: item_network, item_domain, item_type, q, filters,
  //              anchor_item_id, limit, offset

  /** NEW. Absent => server default per §5.2. */
  sort?: 'relevance' | 'newest' | 'nearest',

  // EXISTING FIELDS, MEANING NARROWED — these three now express the AREA
  // FILTER *only*, and the UI sends them ONLY in `radius` area mode.
  // `anywhere` (the default) sends none of them. There is no `area_mode`
  // field: absence IS `anywhere`.
  item_latitude?: number,
  item_longitude?: number,
  distance_meters?: number,

  /**
   * NEW. The ordering centre for `sort: 'nearest'`. Distinct from the area
   * filter above, so the candidate set stays network-wide while the order is
   * nearest-first. Must be sent together (existing paired-field refine
   * pattern applies).
   */
  ordering_latitude?: number,
  ordering_longitude?: number,
}
```

### 5.1 Mapping to the search envelope

| `/discover` field | → `intent` field |
| --- | --- |
| `sort` | `intent.sort` |
| `item_latitude` / `item_longitude` / `distance_meters` | `intent.spatial[0]` (filter) |
| `ordering_latitude` / `ordering_longitude` | `intent.orderingCenter` |

### 5.2 Default `sort` (server-side)

`relevance` when `anchor_item_id` is present, else `newest`. Never error.

---

## 6. Signals-DPG `/discover` — response

```ts
meta: {
  total, limit, offset, source, degraded,

  /**
   * CHANGED: now present only when an AREA FILTER was actually applied
   * (i.e. item_latitude/item_longitude were sent). Previously keyed off
   * "a location was sent", which conflated filtering with ordering.
   * An `ordering_*` centre alone MUST NOT set this.
   */
  distance_meters?: number,

  /** NEW, always present. Passed through from signals-search
   *  meta.sort_applied; on the native fallback, whatever the fallback did. */
  sort_applied: 'relevance' | 'newest' | 'nearest',
}
```

---

## 7. Native fallback (Signals-DPG only)

No wire change. Behaviour, per spec §3.7:

| `sort` | Native call |
| --- | --- |
| `newest` | send **no** lat/lng → `buildDistanceOrderBy` yields `created_at DESC` |
| `nearest` | send lat/lng, **no** `radius_meters` → distance-ordered, unbounded |
| `relevance` | unavailable without ranking → behave as `newest`, report `sort_applied: 'newest'` |

Plus the `item_id` tiebreaker in `buildDistanceOrderBy`
(`apps/api/src/utils/item_fetch_runtime.ts:463-480`).

---

## 8. Match-score scale (Signals-DPG only, no cross-repo impact)

Single wire scale **0–100** end to end, matching what `/v1/relevance` already
emits. Both conversion points deleted:
`packages/match_score/src/providers/signals_search/client.ts:15` (`÷10`) and
`use-match-score.ts:44` (`×10`). signals-search needs **no change** for this —
it already emits 0–100.

---

## 9. Contract test both sides must satisfy

Each repo asserts the same fixture independently, so a divergence fails a test
rather than a deploy.

```
Request  intent = { item: { id: <anchor> },
                    textSearch: 'solar',
                    sort: 'nearest',
                    orderingCenter: { type: 'Point', coordinates: [77.59, 12.97] } }
         pagination = { limit: 20, offset: 0 }

Expect   - NO ST_DWithin predicate in the SQL (nearest must not filter)
         - ORDER BY ends in `s.item_id ASC`
         - text applied as a WHERE predicate, anchor still the query vector
         - meta.sort_applied === 'nearest'
```
